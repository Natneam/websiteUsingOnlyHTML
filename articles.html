                                    It might not have looked this way on the surface, but I’ve spent the last 8-9 months of my life in what I now realize was a mild depression. It wasn’t bad enough for me to realize what it was while I was in the midst of it, especially since I’ve spent the last 10 […]

                                    Motivation is a powerful, yet tricky beast. Sometimes it is really easy to get motivated, and you find yourself wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement. Other times, it is nearly impossible to figure out how to motivate yourself and you're trapped in a death spiral of procrastination. This page contains the best ideas […]

                                    There are some prominent themes in this year’s crop. The Pixar short film Bao, the Lebanese movie Capernaum, and the American indies Leave No Trace and Eighth Grade all explore the process of children becoming independent from their parents, with the pain and pride that entails. Blindspotting, Bohemian Rhapsody, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Annihilation, and Crazy Rich Asians all in their very different ways explore […]

                                    People who claim that setting goals are a bad thing are out of their minds. They probably set some goals in the past, failed, and never set a goal again. I know there’s a lot of confusion about goals and systems these days. I’ve contributed to the confusion as well. A lot of us share the idea that you either have a [...]

                                    Over a hundred years ago, during World War I, a Chicago newspaper found itself being sued by Henry Ford for libel. The paper had labeled Ford an “ignorant pacifist”, and during the trial it attempted to defend the statement by asking Ford a bunch of general knowledge questions in the hopes of exposing his ignorance.

                                    This is not rich people vs. poor people. There are many poor people with a rich mindset, financially poor due to circumstance. And there are many trust fund babies with a poor mindset. Rich mindset understands that the first goal is to gain a surplus of resources. Then, to use that surplus to accelerate things. […]
